* A technique that models a categorical dependent variable (Y) based on one or more independent variables (X). Binomial logistic regression is a technique that models the probability of an observation falling into one of two categories, based on one or more independent variables.   

* The airline is interested in knowing if a better in-flight entertainment experience leads to higher customer satisfaction. They would like you to construct and evaluate a model that predicts whether a future customer would be satisfied with their services given previous customer feedback about their flight experience.

* The data contains a sample size of 129,880 customers. It includes data points such as class, flight distance, and in-flight entertainment, among others. Your goal will be to utilize a binomial logistic regression model to help the airline model and better understand this data. 

**Following steps ü™ú:**

* Importing packages and loading data
* Exploring the data and completing the cleaning process
* Building a binomial logistic regression model 
* Evaluating a binomial logistic regression model using a confusion matrix
